# How to properly build a Servoy Web Component
The official Servoy documentation lives at https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/WebComponents

## Handling security concerns

## Web Component Lifecycle

## Making a Web Component fully compatible with all of Servoy's API

### proper coordination with controller.readOnly
A Servoy Form can be made readOnly through the `controller.readOnly` property. 
When a form is made visible in the UI, the value of `controller.readOnly` is pushed onto all elements on the form that have a property called `readOnly`.

### supporting controller.focusFirstField
In order to support the `controller.focusFirstField` api, the Web Component must:
- implement an api method names `requestFocus`
- must have a property of type `tabseq`
- must support a property called `readOnly`
