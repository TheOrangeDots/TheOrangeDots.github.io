# How to properly build a Servoy Web Component 

## proper coordination with controller.readOnly
A Servoy Form can be made readOnly through the `controller.readOnly` property. 
When a form is made visible in the UI, the value of `controller.readOnly` is pushed onto all elements on the form that have a property called `readOnly`.

## supporting controller.focusFirstField
In order to support the `controller.focusFirstField` api, the Web Component must:
- implement an api method names `requestFocus`
- must have a property of type `tabseq`
